In this app you can compose with onomatopoeia, which are words that
phonetically resemble the sounds that they describe.

The onomatopoeia are in the left-hand menu. An item with red
background has only a textual description and an item with brown
background has both a description and an audio sample.  The audio
samples can be put to the above multitrack player.

The tracks 1â€“8 in the player balance right and left speaker
differently.  The duration of the tracks is shown in the number field in
the right and the current position next to the stop button.

Sounds can be dragged from the menu to the player and from one
position to another in the player. Once in the player, a sound can
also be moved using arrow keys when it is in focus.  When the focus is
not on a sound in the player, left and right keys change the current
position in the player.  When the focus in on a sound in the menu, up
and down arrow keys change the sound and pressing enter adds the sound
to the player to where the player cursor is.

The composition is automatically saved in the page address.
